# eml2text

A command-line too for extracting plain text from an email file; it reads the body of an `eml` file and prints the body as plain text.

## Requirements

Python 3.10.9. (Older versions of Python3 probably work as well.)

## Installation

There are no dependencies. Simply download the eml2text file and either execute it directly or invoke it with python explicitly.

## Usage

Either `eml2text email_file.eml` or `python3 eml2text email_file.eml`.
